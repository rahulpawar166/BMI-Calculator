# BMI-Calculator

This app is developed in Python with the help of TKinter and Bootstarp

It takes following inputs:
1) Weight (In Kg)
2) Height (In Meter)

It then calculates BMI and also describes the BMI like "Underweight (BMI < 18.5)", 
"Normal Weight (18.5 <= BMI < 25)", "Overweight (25 <= BMI < 30)" and "Obese" (BMI >= 30)
